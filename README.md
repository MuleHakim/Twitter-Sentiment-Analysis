# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Twitter is a social media site, and its primary purpose is to connect people and allow people to share their thoughts with a big audience. The tweets may be positive, neutral or negative. we can use Twitter Sentiment Analysis so that we can identify the tweets as positive, neutral or negative. Sentiment analysis is a task of natural language processing. I have used a Kaggle dataset about a long discussion within a group of users on Twitter.
